# Mikel Ega√±a Aranguren, Ph.D.

I am an [Associate Professor](http://go.ehu.eus/mikel-egana-aranguren) at Universidad del Pa√≠s Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), in the Dept. of Computer Languages and Systems.

## Background

My research and development activity is related to the publication and consumption of data following [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), mainly in [Government Open Data](https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/lod/-/linked-open-data/) and [Life Sciences](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/special-issue-linked-data-health-care-and-life-sciences), usually (but not only) through [Linked Data](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q515701). I also work in the application of Knowledge Graphs in [enterprise data-centric architectures](http://www.datacentricmanifesto.org/). 

## Interested?

I am open to any kind of collaboration, including consulting services on areas related to my background, through the [Euskoiker foundation](http://www.euskoiker.ehu.es/). Besides my academic research activity, I have hands-on experience in Linked Open Data projects and data integration through Knowledge Graphs: I have worked at [Eurohelp](https://eurohelp.es/) and [Eccenca GmbH](https://eccenca.com/), and I have done consulting projects for [Cognizone](https://www.cogni.zone/), [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es/), and the [Basque Country Government](https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/lod/-/linked-open-data/).
